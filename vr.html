            <p>Virtual Reality is a computer-generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"
        			                          target="_blank">simulation</a>
              of a 3D environment, which seems very real to the person experiencing it using special electronic equipment.
              The objective is to achieve a strong sense of being present in the virtual environment.
              Today's consumer tech VR involves wearing a head-mounted display, such as goggles,
              to view stereoscopic 3D scenes. You can look around by moving your head
              and walk around by using hand controls or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_detector"
        			                           target="_blank">motion sensors</a>.
              You are engaged in a fully immersive experience; it's as if you're really there in some other virtual world.

              in 1968 by computer scientist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Edward-Sutherland"
        			               target="_blank">Ivan Sutherland</a> with assistance from his pupil Bob Sproull. He was already

              known
              for his achievements
              in the area of computer graphics. One of these accomplishments is <a

              Sutherland and his colleagues
              practiced the world's first head-mounted display experiments. By our time's standards, the features of this
              headset is very primitive,
              from its user interface to the realism and graphics of the simulated world.

	  <div id="text3">
	    <p>While VR technology can be used for games, it can also be used to simulate various kinds of environments,
	      especially specific and
	      hazardous situations. The image on the bottom right shows a virtual reality simulation of the interior of a
	      rocket
	      ship.
	      In this picture, the person is tasked to put out a fire with the use of a fire extinguisher. Virtual reality
	      not
	      only
	      has purpose
	      in recreational entertainment but can be used to simulate unsuitable and dangerous environments that we can
	      use
	      to gain important
	      experience from.
	      The video on the bottom left is a VR spacewalk exploration.

	  <div id="text4">
	    <p>Associated threats with virtual reality are existent. Depending on the simulation, the immersive nature of
	      virtual reality
	      can induce stress or anxiety. For example, a simulation of the Vietnam War can cause the viewer to be
	      unsettled
	      and
	      stressed. It will
	      take a while for the person to recover because they experience everything as if they were really in the
	      conflict. People who use these
	      headsets may complain about dizziness, motion sickness and nausea. Wearable technology like VR headsets may
	      expose the user to harmful
	      electromagnetic frequency radiations. While using a VR Headset you must be in an open and wide area and
	      isolate yourself from objects so that you do not hit them or knock them over while in use.
