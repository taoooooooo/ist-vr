			<p class="explanation">Virtual Reality is a computer-generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"
					target="_blank">simulation</a>
				of a 3D environment, which seems very real to the person experiencing it using special electronic
				equipment.
				The objective is to achieve a strong sense of being present in the virtual environment.
				Today's consumer tech VR involves wearing a head-mounted display, such as goggles,
				to view stereoscopic 3D scenes. You can look around by moving your head
				and walk around by using hand controls or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_detector"
					target="_blank">motion sensors</a>.
				You are engaged in a fully immersive experience; it's as if you're really there in some other virtual
				world.

		<div id="text2">
			<p class="explanation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)" target="_blank">The Sword
					of
					Damocles</a>(the
				headset above) is widely considered to be the first VR head-mounted display system. It was created
				in 1968 by computer scientist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Edward-Sutherland"
					target="_blank">Ivan Sutherland</a> with assistance from his pupil Bob Sproull. He was already
				well
				known
				for his achievements
				in the area of computer graphics. One of these accomplishments is <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad" target="_blank">Sketchpad</a>. At <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory" target="_blank"> MIT's Lincoln
					Laboratory</a>,
				Sutherland and his colleagues
				practiced the world's first head-mounted display experiments. By our time's standards, the features of
				this
				headset is very primitive,
				from its user interface to the realism and graphics of the simulated world.

		<h2 id="title3" class="title">Uses of Virtual reality</h2>

		<div id="text3">
			<p class="explanation">While VR technology can be used for games, it can also be used to simulate various kinds of environments,
				especially specific and
				hazardous situations. The image on the bottom right shows a virtual reality simulation of the interior
				of a
				rocket
				ship.
				In this picture, the person is tasked to put out a fire with the use of a fire extinguisher. Virtual
				reality
				not
				only
				has purpose
				in recreational entertainment but can be used to simulate unsuitable and dangerous environments that we
				can
				use
				to gain important
				experience from.
				The video on the bottom left is a VR spacewalk exploration.

		<h2 id="title4" class="title">Risks associated with Virtual reality</h2>
		<div id="img4"><img class="image" src="vrmotionsickness.jpg"></div>
		<div id="text4">
			<p class="explanation">Associated threats with virtual reality are existent. Depending on the simulation, the immersive nature
				of
				virtual reality
				can induce stress or anxiety. For example, a simulation of the Vietnam War can cause the viewer to be
				unsettled
				and
				stressed. It will
				take a while for the person to recover because they experience everything as if they were really in the
				conflict. People who use these
				headsets may complain about dizziness, motion sickness and nausea. Wearable technology like VR headsets
				may
				expose the user to harmful
				electromagnetic frequency radiations. While using a VR Headset you must be in an open and wide area and
				isolate yourself from objects so that you do not hit them or knock them over while in use.
