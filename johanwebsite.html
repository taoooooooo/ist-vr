	<h2 id="what-is-vr">What is Virtual reality?</h2>
	<p>Virtual Reality is a computer-generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">simulation</a> of a 3D
		environment, which seems very real to the person
		experiencing it using special electronic equipment. The objective is to achieve a strong sense of being present
		in the
		virtual environment. Today's consumer tech VR involves wearing a head-mounted display, such as goggles, to view
		stereoscopic 3D
		scenes. You can look around by moving your head and walk around by using hand controls or motion sensors.
		You are engaged in a fully immersive experience; it's as if you're really there in some other virtual world.</p>

	<h2 id="history">History</h2>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)">The Sword of Damocles</a>(the
		headset on the left) is widely considered to be the first VR head-mounted display system. It was created
		in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland with the help of his pupil Bob Sproull. He was already well known
		for his achievements
		in the area of computer graphics. One of these accomplishments is Sketchpad. At MIT's Lincoln Laboratory,
		Sutherland and his colleagues
		practiced the world's first head-mounted display experiments. By our time's standards, the features of this
		headset is very primitive,
		from its user interface to the realism and graphics of the siumlated world.

	<h2 id="uses">Uses of Virtual reality</h2>
	<p>While VR technology can be used for games, it can also be used to simulate various kinds of environments,
		especially specific and
		hazardous situations. The image on the left shows a virtual reality simulation of the interior of a rocket ship.
		In this specific
		simulation, the person is tasked to put out a fire with the use of a fire extinguisher. Virtual reality not only
		has purpose
		in recreational entertainment but can be used to simulate unsuitable and dangerous environments that we can use
		to gain important
		experience from.

	<h2 id="hazards-and-dangers">Threats and dangers associated with Virtual reality</h2>
	<p>Associated threats with virtual reality are existent. Depending on the simulation, the immersive nature of
		virtual reality
		can induce stress or anxiety. For example, a simulation of the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> can cause the viewer to be unsettled and
		stressed. It will
		take a while for the person to recover because they experience everything as if they were really in the
		conflict. People who use these
		headsets may complain about dizziness, motion sickness and nausea. Wearable technology like VR headsets may
		expose the user to harmful
		electromagnetic frequency radiations.
